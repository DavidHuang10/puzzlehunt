# Linked List Cycle Detection

Detect cycles in a linked list. Pass all tests to unlock a hidden clue!

## Problem

Given a linked list where **each node has a unique value**, return `True` if there's a cycle, `False` otherwise.

## Getting Started

### 1. Implement Your Solution
Edit `solution.py` and implement the `has_cycle()` function:

```python
def has_cycle(head):
    # TODO: Write your solution!
    return False
```

### 2. Test Your Implementation
```bash
python3 test_runner.py
```
Runs **32 comprehensive test cases**. Pass all to unlock the hidden clue!


##  Reward

Complete all 32 test cases successfully to reveal a hidden clue!

## Files

- `solution.py` - **Edit this file** with your implementation
- `test_runner.py` - Run this for full testing (32 tests)
- `linkedlist.py` - Utilities (don't edit)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Each node value is unique 
- Head always exists (no empty lists)
- 1 ≤ list length ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ node values ≤ 10000

## Troubleshooting

**Function not found**: Make sure your function is named exactly `has_cycle`

**Import errors**: Ensure you're running from the correct directory

 **Ready?** Edit `solution.py` and run `python3 test_runner.py` to get started!
