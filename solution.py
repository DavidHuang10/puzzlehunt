Linked List Cycle Detection Challenge

Your task: Implement the has_cycle function to detect if a linked list has a cycle.

Problem Description:
Given the head of a linked list where each node has a unique value, determine 
if the linked list has a cycle in it.

A cycle exists when you can reach a node again by continuously following the 
next pointer. 

Return True if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return False.

Constraints:
- Each node value is unique
- The head always exists (no empty lists)
- 1 ≤ list length ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ node values ≤ 10000

ListNode Structure:
  node.val               # Access value: int
  node.next              # Access next node: ListNode or None
